* Version 2.1 :
    The binary search could return -1 as a slot number when a hash key
wasn't found. It has been fixed.
    The regression tests are now also probing for unknown hashes.
    Autoconf/Automake were updated.    

* Version 2.0 :
    Use binary search instead of linear search for lower byte lookup.
Contributed by Philip Gladstone.
    New --with-minimal configure switch to disable binary search (and
possibly other stuff in the future) .
    Some operating systems don't support rename() to an existing file for
atomic replacements. So we just unlink() the file if a previous rename()
failed.

* Version 1.3 :
    Upgraded to Autoconf 2.52f.
    Merged the fixes from Pure-FTPd 1.0.

* Version 1.2 :
    Portability improvements, added forgotten casts, removed wrong ones.
    Don't forget to initialize every pointer of a dbw structure with NULL,
so that puredbw_free() can be called at any time, even after a
puredbw_open() failure.

* Version 1.1 :
    Added "regression" program.
    Fixed a pointer arithmetic error in puredb_write.

* Version 1.0 :
    Initial release.
